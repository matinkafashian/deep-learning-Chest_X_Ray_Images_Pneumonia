2. **Sign in**:
   - Sign in to your GitHub account using your credentials.

3. **Navigate to your repository**:
   - Go to the repository you want to delete. You can find it in your list of repositories on your GitHub profile.

4. **Go to the repository settings**:
   - On the repository page, click on the **"Settings"** tab. This is located near the top of the page, right next to the "Insights" tab.

5. **Scroll to the bottom**:
   - Scroll down to the bottom of the settings page.

6. **Delete the repository**:
   - Under the "Danger Zone" section, you will find an option called **"Delete this repository"**. Click on the **"Delete this repository"** button.

7. **Confirm the deletion**:
   - A confirmation dialog will appear, asking you to type the name of the repository to confirm that you want to delete it. Type the name of the repository exactly as it appears (for example, `username/repository-name`).

8. **Confirm deletion**:
   - After typing the repository name, click on the **"I understand the consequences, delete this repository"** button.

   **Warning**: Deleting a repository is **permanent** and cannot be undone. All issues, pull requests, and the entire repository will be lost.
